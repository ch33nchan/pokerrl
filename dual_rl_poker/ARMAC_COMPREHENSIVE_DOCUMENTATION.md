## Concept and Mathematical Foundation

### Overview
ARMAC (Actor-Critic with Regret Matching) is a dual reinforcement learning approach that combines actor-critic methods with regret matching for solving sequential games. The method addresses the fundamental challenge of exploration in zero-sum games by maintaining both policy-based and regret-based representations of the game strategy.

### Mathematical Framework

#### Advantage Computation
The core of ARMAC lies in its advantage computation, which follows the standard advantage function definition:

```
A(I,a) = q_θ(I,a) - Σ_a' π(a'|I)q_θ(I,a')
```

Where:
- `I` represents the information state
- `a` represents a legal action
- `q_θ(I,a)` is the critic's Q-value estimate
- `π(a'|I)` is the actor's policy probability

#### Regret Matching Policy Updates
ARMAC implements regret matching through the following update rule:

```
π_{t+1}(a|I) ∝ max(A(I,a), 0)
```

This ensures that actions with positive advantage are reinforced while those with negative advantage are penalized.

#### Actor-Regret Mixture
The final policy is a mixture of the actor and regret-matching policies:

```
π_final(a|I) = λ * π_regret(a|I) + (1-λ) * π_actor(a|I)
```

Where λ is a sweepable hyperparameter that can be:
- Fixed: Constant value throughout training
- Adaptive: Dynamically adjusted based on loss differences

#### Adaptive Lambda Computation
For adaptive λ scheduling, ARMAC uses a sigmoid-based approach:

```
λ_t = sigmoid(α * (L_regret - L_policy))
```

Where:
- `L_regret` is the exponential moving average of regret losses
- `L_policy` is the exponential moving average of policy losses
- `α` is a scaling hyperparameter

## Architecture and Implementation

### Core Components

#### ARMACDualRL Class
The `ARMACDualRL` class implements the core dual RL functionality:

- **Advantage Computation**: Calculates advantages using critic Q-values and actor policies
- **Regret Matching**: Implements regret-matching policy updates
- **Lambda Scheduling**: Manages both fixed and adaptive lambda computation
- **Loss Tracking**: Maintains exponential moving averages for adaptive lambda

#### Network Architecture
ARMAC uses a standard MLP architecture:
- Input layer: Information state encoding
- Hidden layers: 64-64 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: Q-values for all actions

#### Training Pipeline
The training follows these steps:
1. Data collection through self-play
2. Advantage computation using current networks
3. Regret-matching policy updates
4. Actor-critic parameter updates
5. Policy mixture with lambda weighting
