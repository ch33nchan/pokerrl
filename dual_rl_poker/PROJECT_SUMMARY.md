# Dual RL Poker - Project Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: Complete Implementation

## Abstract

This project implements three algorithm families for sequential decision-making in poker games: Deep CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization), SD-CFR (Self-Play Deep CFR), and ARMAC (Actor-Critic with Regret Matching). The implementation provides a modular framework for comparing neural network-based approaches to solving imperfect information games.

## Technical Implementation

- **SD-CFR**: Enhanced self-play with adaptive exploration (14,600 parameters)
- **ARMAC**: Actor-Critic architecture with regret matching integration (10,000+ parameters)

### Game Support
- **Kuhn Poker**: 12 information states, 3-card deck
- **Leduc Hold'em**: 288 information states, 6-card deck
