# ARMAC Paper - Complete Version with All Tables and Figures

## Overview
This directory contains the complete ARMAC paper with all tables, figures, and fixes applied. The paper uses the standard academic format with two-column main content and single-column pages for all tables and figures at the end. The paper addresses the original issues with fake GPU claims and table overflows while maintaining comprehensive experimental results.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. REMOVED FAKE GPU CLAIMS
- **Problem:** Paper claimed GPU utilization percentages (78%, 65%, etc.) but all experiments were CPU-based
- **Solution:** Replaced with actual CPU training times and explicit statement that all experiments were CPU-based

### 2. FIXED TABLE OVERFLOW ISSUES
- **Problem:** Tables had too many columns and were overflowing page width
- **Solution:** Restructured tables with proper column organization and moved all tables to single-column pages at the end for better readability

### 3. USED ONLY REAL EXPERIMENTAL DATA
- **Problem:** Some numbers appeared fabricated rather than from actual experiments
- **Solution:** All metrics verified against `results/enhanced_manifest.csv` from 291 training runs

## 📊 Complete Paper Contents

### Paper Structure:
- **Pages 1-6:** Two-column main content with Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Discussion
- **Pages 7-10:** Single-column pages with all tables and figures for better readability

## 🔍 Data Verification

All computational metrics were cross-referenced against the actual experimental manifest:
- **Training times** → `wall_clock_s` field from real experiments
- **Parameter counts** → `params_count` field from configurations  
- **FLOPs estimates** → `flops_est` field from experimental logs
- **Performance metrics** → Real data from 291 training runs

## ✅ Final Result

The paper now contains:
- ✅ **No fake GPU claims** - All CPU-based with real training times
- ✅ **All tables included** - 9 comprehensive tables with no overflow issues
- ✅ **All figures included** - 4 figures showing training dynamics and performance
- ✅ **Only verified data** - Every number traceable to experimental results
- ✅ **Academic integrity** - Honest reporting of computational requirements

The complete paper maintains scientific rigor while ensuring accurate, verifiable experimental reporting. The single-column format for tables and figures at the end follows standard academic conference formatting and provides much better readability for complex data presentations.
