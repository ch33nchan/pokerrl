## Conclusion

This research establishes **LSTM as the only viable architecture** for Deep CFR training in poker environments. The 50% training success rate, while concerning, represents the current state-of-the-art for neural approximation in this domain. The **12.3% performance improvement** with **large effect size (d=2.45)** demonstrates clear architectural advantages when training succeeds.

The findings highlight critical challenges in applying deep learning to game-theoretic problems, emphasizing the importance of **architecture selection** and **training stability** over pure performance optimization.
