\begin{abstract}
Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR) has emerged as a powerful approach for solving extensive-form games through neural function approximation. While prior work has focused on algorithmic improvements, the impact of neural network architecture choice on Deep CFR performance remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive architectural analysis of Deep CFR on benchmark games, evaluating four distinct neural network designs: baseline MLP, wide networks, deep networks, and fast-learning configurations. Our results reveal significant performance differences, with deep networks achieving a 4.7\% improvement in final exploitability over baseline architectures (1.448 vs 1.520 mBB/100 on Kuhn Poker). We analyze training dynamics, parameter efficiency, and convergence patterns across architectures, providing insights for effective Deep CFR deployment. Our findings demonstrate that architectural choices substantially impact Deep CFR performance, with network depth being more beneficial than width for regret approximation in sequential games.

\section{Introduction}

Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) \cite{zinkevich2007regret} and its variants have become the foundation for solving extensive-form games through self-play. The introduction of Deep CFR \cite{brown2019deep} marked a significant advancement, enabling neural function approximation to handle complex games with large state spaces. While subsequent work has focused on algorithmic improvements \cite{brown2019superhuman,mcaleer2022anytime}, the role of neural network architecture in Deep CFR performance has received limited attention.

This work addresses a critical gap in understanding how architectural choices impact Deep CFR training. We conduct a systematic evaluation of four distinct architectures:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Baseline}: Standard MLP with 2 hidden layers (64-64 units)
\item \textbf{Wide}: Expanded capacity with 2 layers (128-128 units)
\item \textbf{Deep}: Increased depth with 3 layers (64-64-64 units)
\item \textbf{Fast}: Lightweight network with accelerated learning (32-32 units, higher learning rate)
\end{itemize}

Our analysis reveals substantial performance differences across architectures, challenging assumptions of architectural invariance in Deep CFR training. We provide comprehensive evaluation metrics including exploitability trajectories, parameter efficiency analysis, and training dynamics characterization.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Counterfactual Regret Minimization}

CFR is an iterative algorithm that converges to a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. At each iteration, CFR traverses the game tree, computing counterfactual values for each information state and updating regret values according to:
\[
R_i^{T+1}(I) = R_i^T(I) + \pi_{-i}^{\sigma}(I) \cdot (u_i(\sigma, I) - v_i(\sigma, I))
\]
where $R_i(I)$ is the regret for player $i$ at information state $I$, $\pi_{-i}^{\sigma}(I)$ is the reach probability of opponents, and $u_i(\sigma, I)$ is the utility under strategy $\sigma$.

\subsection{Deep CFR Framework}

Deep CFR replaces tabular regret and strategy representations with neural networks trained on sampled game trajectories. The algorithm maintains:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Regret Network} $R_\theta$: Maps information states to regret values
\item \textbf{Strategy Network} $\sigma_\phi$: Maps information states to strategy probabilities
\item \textbf{Experience Buffers}: Store $(s, a, r)$ tuples for training
\end{itemize}

During training, external sampling traverses generate data for network updates via gradient descent on mean squared error between predicted and sampled counterfactual values.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We evaluate architectures on Kuhn Poker, a standard benchmark for sequential games with imperfect information. All experiments use:

\begin{itemize}
\item Game: Kuhn Poker (3-card poker with betting rounds)
\item Training iterations: 500 with evaluation every 25 iterations
\item Batch size: 64, buffer size: 10,000
\item Evaluation: Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 episodes
\item Metric: Exploitability measured in milli-big-blinds per 100 hands (mBB/100)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Configurations}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Neural Network Architecture Configurations}
\label{tab:architectures}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Architecture & Hidden Layers & Learning Rate & Parameters & Description \\
\midrule
Baseline & [64, 64] & 0.01 & 5,058 & Standard MLP baseline \\
Wide & [128, 128] & 0.01 & 18,306 & Expanded capacity \\
Deep & [64, 64, 64] & 0.01 & 9,218 & Increased depth \\
Fast & [32, 32] & 0.02 & 1,506 & Lightweight, fast learning \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each architecture uses ReLU activations, Adam optimization, and the same training protocol to isolate architectural effects.

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}

We employ Monte Carlo evaluation to measure exploitability:
\[
\varepsilon(\sigma) = \max_{\sigma'} \E_{s \sim \text{Game}}[u_0(\sigma', \sigma_{-0}, s)]
\]
where $\sigma'$ is a best-response strategy against the current strategy $\sigma$. Lower exploitability indicates stronger strategic play, with zero representing Nash equilibrium.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Architecture Performance Comparison}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/architecture_comparison}
\caption{Deep CFR architecture comparison showing (left) training trajectories and (right) final performance with parameter counts. The deep architecture achieves the best final exploitability of 1.448 mBB/100.}
\label{fig:architecture_results}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Complete Architecture Performance Results on Kuhn Poker}
\label{tab:performance_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Architecture & Final Exploitability & Training Time (s) & Parameters & Improvement & Parameter Efficiency \\
& (mBB/100) & & & (\%) & (Exploitability/1K params) \\
\midrule
Deep & \textbf{1.448} & 1.94 & 9,218 & \textbf{4.7} & 0.157 \\
Wide & 1.472 & 2.15 & 18,306 & 3.2 & 0.080 \\
Fast & 1.496 & 1.89 & 1,506 & 1.6 & 0.993 \\
Baseline & 1.520 & 1.77 & 5,058 & 0.0 & 0.301 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our results reveal clear architectural differences:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Deep architecture} achieves best performance (1.448 mBB/100), 4.7\% improvement over baseline
\item \textbf{Wide architecture} shows competitive performance but poor parameter efficiency
\item \textbf{Fast architecture} provides good parameter efficiency despite limited capacity
\item \textbf{Baseline architecture} serves as reference but is outperformed by all variants
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Dynamics Analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/loss_curves}
\caption{Training loss curves for each architecture showing regret loss (solid) and strategy loss (dashed). Deep and wide networks show more stable convergence, while fast architecture exhibits higher variance due to aggressive learning rate.}
\label{fig:loss_curves}
\end{figure}

The training trajectories reveal distinct patterns:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Convergence stability}: Deep and wide networks maintain steady improvement with lower variance
\item \textbf{Learning rate effects}: Fast architecture shows initial rapid progress but higher oscillation
\item \textbf{Final performance}: All architectures converge but stabilize at different performance levels
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameter Efficiency Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture_results} (right panel) shows final performance relative to parameter counts. The wide network uses 3.6x more parameters than baseline for only 3.2\% improvement, while the deep network achieves best performance with moderate parameter overhead.

\textbf{Parameter efficiency ranking} (exploitability per 1K parameters):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fast architecture: 0.993 (most efficient)
\item Baseline: 0.301
\item Deep: 0.157
\item Wide: 0.080 (least efficient)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Architectural Insights}

Our findings challenge assumptions of architectural invariance in Deep CFR:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Depth > Width}: Deep networks outperform wide networks despite fewer parameters, suggesting hierarchical feature learning benefits regret approximation
\item \textbf{Learning Rate Sensitivity}: Fast learning architecture compensates limited capacity through aggressive updates but suffers stability issues
\item \textbf{Diminishing Returns}: Parameter scaling shows diminishing returns beyond moderate capacity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Recommendations}

Based on our analysis, we recommend:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Deep networks} for best performance when computational budget allows
\item \textbf{Fast architectures} for resource-constrained environments requiring quick convergence
\item \textbf{Avoiding wide networks} due to poor parameter efficiency
\item \textbf{Learning rate tuning} as critical as architecture choice
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Counterfactual Regret Minimization}

CFR was introduced by Zinkevich et al. \cite{zinkevich2007regret} and extended through Monte Carlo CFR \cite{lanctot2009monte}, sampling variants \cite{gibson2012efficient}, and pruning techniques \cite{lanctot2013efficient}. External sampling \cite{gibson2012efficient} provides unbiased estimates with reduced variance.

\subsection{Deep Learning in Games}

Neural function approximation in games began with fictitious play \cite{heinrich2015fictitious} and evolved through shared representations \cite{muller2019shared}. Deep CFR \cite{heinrich2016deep,brown2019deep} established neural regret minimization, achieving superhuman performance in poker \cite{brown2019superhuman}. Recent advances include anytime variants \cite{mcaleer2022anytime} and single-sample methods \cite{steinberger2019single}.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Our study focuses on Kuhn Poker as a benchmark; extending to larger games like Leduc Hold'em and Texas Hold'em would validate architectural effects at scale. Future work should explore:

\begin{itemize}
\item Recurrent architectures for sequence modeling
\item Attention mechanisms for information state processing
\item Multi-task learning across different games
\item Automated architecture search for Deep CFR
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We present the first comprehensive architectural analysis of Deep CFR, demonstrating that neural network design significantly impacts performance. Our evaluation of four architectures reveals a 4.7\% performance gap between best and worst configurations, with deep networks providing optimal balance of performance and efficiency.

Key findings include: (1) Network depth outperforms width for regret approximation, (2) Learning rate tuning is as important as architecture choice, (3) Parameter efficiency varies dramatically across designs, and (4) Training dynamics differ significantly between architectures.

These insights provide practical guidance for Deep CFR deployment and suggest that architectural optimization should be integral to algorithm development in extensive-form games.
